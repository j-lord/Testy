This is a new file that is being added

So if I want to keep track of this one from this point

Until this point here
These changes haven't been committed but they are being looked at from the git add fileName
What about now ?

You can one line the add/commit by saying commit -a as the -a adds all of the files that have been changed
git commit -a -m "test"

Then we can come and change some things
