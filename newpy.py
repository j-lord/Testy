// the question is what type of repository it should focus on
// a portfolio site that has several things that come to mind??
// where you can add models that you make in blender to it
// the real question is if the node module package can fit in the repository
// lets look into this

// Either way, a publically available portfolio of all of your projects
// would be benificial for a place to keep everything that you are working on
// YOU NEED a place to point people to, in order to show them what you are
// working on and have the ability to do
// I thought about an option portfolio showing various strats running, or perhps even allowing users to back test methods on available data.
// will have to look into what it cost to redistribute date to non-professionals and how to charge for it

// Alright, you have been rambling along just for the sake of commits
// Need to figure out what type of website you want to make in order
// to point potential recruiters/colleagues to in order to show what you have done
